This tile is considered as an Electric type tile\n\nConductance: When the holder receives damage, this effect is converted to Paralysis. This effect is considered as an Electric type debuff\n\nParalysis: Unable to execute commands. Unable to use normal attacks or skills. This effect is considered as an Electric type debuff\n\nCyclotron Potential: Before using a single target active attack, applies Conductance for 1 turn. This effect cannot be dispelled\n\nPreemptive Strike: When enemies within a 8 tile radius attempt to use an active attack, decreases Contamination Gauge by 3 points, and activates Ambush, dealing Electric damage equivalent to 80% ATK and 2 Stability damage to the target. There is a 50% chance of inflicting Electric before attacking for 1 turn. This effect is considered as a buff, and cannot be dispelled\n\nChill: Cannot move or be displaced.
